## What I will be posting

As developers, we are learning new things every day.

In this blog I want to share what I'm currently learning, but also what I've learned.

So if you want to know more about the development of APIs and machine learning, from a developer with more than 10 years of experience, please follow me on Twitter, subscribe to my newsletter or to my RSS feed.

Special thank you to Lailo and his [open source code](https://github.com/lailo/next-with-tailwindcss) that I used for this blog.
